# LatteSite - a SSG (Static Site Generator) framework in Java

LatteSite is an [SEO (Search Engine Optimization)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization) focused,
lightweight [SSG (Static Site Generator)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) framework that 
uses [OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) principles,
written in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)).



## Why this project got created

I got tired of using multiple frameworks and languages just to create a blazing fast static website that
should achieve 100% [Google Lighthouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lighthouse_(software)) scores.

So I started to create my own SSG using the most popular and versatile backend language I knew; Java.



## Site generation features

 - Generate HTML based on POJO
 - Sitemap generator
 - Structured Data support
 - Google Merchant Feed (XML) support
 - Maintains a public/ and static/ folder structure
 - Localization support
 - A built-in basic CSS/Stylesheet framework



## This project is very young

This is a newly created project, so it lacks a lot of common features, as well as a structure and ways of working.

However, these can be defined and established if the project grows in popularity.



## Principles

 - Lightweight framework with not a lot of moving parts
 - SOLID
 - Keep the code simple with POJO (Plain Old Java Objects)
 - Object Oriented Programming style
 - Beans, services, and utils using Dependency Injection patterns
 - A single exported JAR artifact
 

## Architectural overview

The framework currently consists of these main features:

- HTML Elements & Custom Composite Components 

  There should be a POJO for each common [HTML element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element).

  You should be able to create your own library of custom composite components.

- HTML generator

  There is a default HTML generator included that you can use, extend or create your own

- Sitemap Generator

  There is also a default sitemap.xml generator included that you can use

- Pages and Page Generator (NOT YET ADDED)

  There is a concept of a standard HTML Page that you can use, extend, or create your own

  There is also a default Page HTML generator included that you can use, extend or create your own

- i18n Localization

  It can handle a website using multiple locales

## What about JavaScript?

At the current time, there is no official way to implement JavaScript.

This means that for the time being you can use whatever frameworks you want.
